IBISServerClient
License: LGPL
Technology: Java

DESCRIPTION
This is a simple desktop client which communicates with the IBIS-Server online.
It is capable of uploading existing Compendium exported XML documents to the server,
and to download selected files from the server.

It really is intended to model candidate extensions to Compendium itself such that
files can be handled directly in Compendium, say, by a new feature: Export to Server, or
Import from Server.

Eventually, the server should be extended to index each of the documents it has, allowing
a new feature to be added to Compendium which allows one to choose a "parent" node, create
a query string based, say, on the topic of that node, ask the server with that query,
and receive a list of nodes which satisfy that query, from which new "child" nodes can be
added to the IBIS conversation directly.

BUILDING
This is an Eclipse project. To build it with Ant or Maven, suitable build or pom files
must be created.

USAGE 
That is explained in the PDF file IBISServerDesign.pdf.
Briefly, on bootup, the client asks for the URL and port of the server.
When files are uploaded, the file must be selected by browsing, then a short description is added,
and the file type, which depends on the platform from which the document derives:
	For Compendium, enter "cm" without the quotes.
Files can be downloaded from the server by using the Server menu to fetch the latest list of
available files, then clicking on the desired file. That file is brought down, after which
it must be saved to the directory and with the desired name.
